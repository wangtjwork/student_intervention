    "**Answer: ** \n",
    "\n",
    "1.Decision Trees:\n",
    "  * Decision Trees are widely used in industry, especially in the field of finance. For example some of the decisions in stock market, like when to buy in or sell out depends on the results of decision tree models.\n",
    "  * The model performs well when there are non-linearalities between parameters.\n",
    "  * The model could easily overfit without proper restrictions, making them do badly on the testing set.\n",
    "  * Decision Trees automatically performs feature selection. I believe this is an advantage given there are so many dummy columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.K-Nearest Neighbors:\n",
    "  * K-nearest Neighbor algorithm has been applied to fault detection of semiconductor manufacturing field. Because of non-linearality between features, constantly changing data set and process step of various situations, KNN has proven to be an ideal method. (reference:https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3284325_Fault_Detection_Using_the_k-Nearest_Neighbor_Rule_for_Semiconductor_Manufacturing_Processes)\n",
    "  * The model takes no time to build, and has good robustness, therefore particularly helpful when dealing with large amount of noisy data. Have no need of a priori knowledge of the nature of the case.\n",
    "  * The model's performance is depended on which distance we use. It also needs more time than most other models when making decisions, which makes it not very ideal when having to make decisions frequently.\n",
    "  * Since the inner reasons of the students' ability to finish the courses in time remains unknown, I believe KNN would have been a good choice for this problem. Also, although the decision space has many divisions, there are not so many known points in there, so I believe it would not be too slow.\n",
    "  \n",
    "3.Support Vector Machines(SVM):\n",
    "  * Support Vector Machine algorithm is like a combination of KNN and linear regression. SVM found its place in chemical industry, like drug design, quantitive structure-activity relationships, chemometrics and so on.(http://www.ivanciuc.org/Files/Reprint/Ivanciuc_Applications_of_Support_Vector_Machines_in_Chemistry.pdf).\n",
    "  * The model can handle complex non-linear relationship between input and output by using the kernel trick within itself, and could produce complicated-shape boundaries. In reality it really could be matched in performance\n",
    "  * The model requires complicated calculation process. After all those data transformation, people could easily get lost. So if it goes wrong it's hard to fix, quite like a black box.\n",
    "  * This dataset is surely of non-linear relationship. And SVMs are used first by classification problems. Also it's not large, so maybe SVMs will do the trick."

    "With the predefined functions above, you will now import the three supervised learning models of your choice and run the `train_predict` function for each one. Remember that you will need to train and predict on each classifier for three different training set sizes: 100, 200, and 300. Hence, you should expect to have 9 different outputs below — 3 for each model using the varying training set sizes. In the following code cell, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    "- Import the three supervised learning models you've discussed in the previous section.\n",
    "- Initialize the three models and store them in `clf_A`, `clf_B`, and `clf_C`.\n",

    "Support Vector Machines, although with a complicated name, is surprisingly easy to understand in its beginning. Its basic idea is to find a hyperplane that successfully separates two kinds of points in a high-dimensional space, which in itself is called linear regression. To improve the classifier, we expand the hyperplane to both up and down, while at the same time make sure that no points are wrongly classified. It is somehow equal to saying that we care most about the points nearer to the hyperplane, and give less weight to those points further away from the hyperplane, which makes sense because the points near the hyperplane would be more easily classified wrong. \n",
